# This is a sample AUTO-07P script file.  This file uses the
# entire AUTO-07P command set, except for the plotting commands.

# with fewer commands).

# The next two commands are sent to the shell

# Copy the wav demo into the current directory.  This command
# also loads in the problem definition file wav.c and the

# the concatenation of the 'copyDemo' command and the
# 'ld' command

# Check what files are in the current directory
ls
# Print out the short online help for all the commands

# Load the files wav.c, c.wav, s.wav, and h.wav into the AUTO
# command interpretor.   If either the s.wav or the h.wav file
# does not exist it is silently ignored, since they are not
# necessarily required to run AUTO.  NOTE:  in this case this
# command is not needed since its functionality is included
# in the 'dm' command.  It is put here for clarity.
ld("wav")
# This loop runs the AUTO using each of the constants files
# c.wav.2, c.wav.3, c.wav.4, and c.wav.5.  The

# use to generate the constants file names.

ld(cir)
# Or, you may load in the files are part of the 'run' command
# itself.  In this case we have used the extended form, in which
# each filename is given individually.  This command loads in
# the files c.cir1, and s.dat and then runs AUTO.
